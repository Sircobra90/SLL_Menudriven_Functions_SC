# Singly Linked List in C

This repository contains a basic implementation of a **singly linked list** in the C programming language. The list supports the following operations:

- Append a node
- Display the linked list
- Count the number of nodes

## Features

- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`
- Menu-driven user interface for interaction
- Loop-based traversal for display and counting
- Clear inline comments for understanding each step of the logic

## Code Structure

- `struct Node`: Defines the node structure with `data` and `next` pointers.
- `append()`: Adds a new node to the end of the list.
- `display()`: Prints all the nodes in the list.
- `count()`: Returns the number of nodes in the list.
